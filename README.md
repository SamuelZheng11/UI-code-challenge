# UI-code-challenge

Hi!

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us this week.

As previously mentioned, we would now like you to complete a brief code challenge in order for us
to get an understanding of your approach to UI development.

Your task will be to build the page layout shown in the design PDF's provided.

## Instructions:

- Fork this repo (this contains all assets required, as well as a data.json file to serve as a mock API)
- Generate a new React application (Create React App is fine for time restraints)
- Build and style the all components necessary to replicate the design as accurately as possible
- Once complete, upload your project to your Github/Bitbucket account and provide us with a link to review. Please include in your README.md any necessary instructions to run your project locally.


The most important aspects that we will be reviewing is your attention to detail. This will include your ability to replicate the design, as well as your ability make the layout responsive. We ask that the cards specifcally adjust to two across on smaller devices (i.e mobile), and three across for medium-sized devices (i.e tablets). 


Please refrain from using any third-party CSS libraries such as Boostrap or Material Design. 

### Extra credit
We understand time restraints - so the following are completely optional
- Unit test
- Accessibility checks (and variation on design to meet standards)
- Interactive elements (i.e load, hover, click interactions)

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us!
