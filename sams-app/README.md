Hey! this is my implementation for the coding project at NetFront

### Running the project

To run the project make sure you are in the `UI-code-challenge/sams-app` then run `npm install` and then run `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### What I have done

 - Quick design documents for what I have built
 - Hover/Click functionality for the cards on the dashboard (to see hover function)
 - Responsiveness (, please use the chrome debugger. I tested it on my browser (chrome),  iphone 6/7/8, Galaxy 5, IPad)
 - text for different languages can be passed in (globalizable)
 - _variable.scss for branding guidelines
 - Dashboard data.json read-in (to test changes, edit the data.json and save, the changes should be reflected in the web-app if/when it runs)
 - Loading functionality (spinner) while awaiting (delayed) mock content service result for data.json
 - Badges for `published` & `unpublished`
 - to-top button
 - configurable breadcrumbs
 - setup the testing framework (Jest)
 - header
 - footer

 ### What I did not have done (due to time constraints)

 - scroll-to-top functionality when to-top button is clicked
 - Unit or Integration tests
 - Follow accessibility standards
